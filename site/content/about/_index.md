## ABOUT ME

I'm a normal dude by day but also an aspiring artist by night. I've read a lot of comics/manga in these past few years an thought I'd give it a shot.  I started out as a more traditional artist with pencils/charcoals, but with my recent purchase of an iPad and Apple Pen digital art is even easier!  I really want to grow and see what type of stories I can tell and host them on here so maybe one person gets the joy out of reading them.

## ABOUT THE WEBSITE

I built this website with Hugo on Netlify, with the help/inspiration from [Clay Yount](https://clayyount.com) ! Check his stuff out.

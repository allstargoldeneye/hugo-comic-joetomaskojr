## ABOUT ME

I'm a web designer/developer and comic artist. I've been making webcomics since 2000 when I started a strip for my university newspaper, and I've been developing websites since I realized I needed a place to put those comics. I've since made a career out of one of these skills, I'll let you guess which one.

## ABOUT GHOSTCAT COMICS
 
Named after my internet handle (which ironically was named after an old comic I drew), these are social media style 1-4 panel comics, and an exercise in restraint.

## ABOUT HAMLET'S DANISH

These are my longer format comics that play out more like short comedy sketches. They updates when I get an idea for a comic that needs more room to fully flesh out.

## ABOUT ROB AND ELLIOT

A comic my brother, [Hampton](http://hamptonyount.com/) and I worked on from 2004-2012. It follows the exploits of two guys, but I forget their names. Hampton wrote it and I drew it.

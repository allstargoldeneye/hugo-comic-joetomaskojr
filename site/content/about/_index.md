## ABOUT ME

Yo! I'm Joe Tomasko, Jr. and have enjoyed comics, video games, art, and movies for so long that I want to host my own website showing my art and comics.  Have a blast!  Enjoy the stories, the blogs, your life! Learn some things!  Show your friends?
Anyways, I do this for fun amongst life's events and distractions.  It's like a super hero and his/her alter ego, except I don't change my clothes and uh...don't shoot laser beams out of my pecs...yet.   

Hell, since you visited this page here's some music I listen to as a little taste.

## ABOUT THE WEBSITE

I built this website with Hugo on Netlify, and with [Clay Yount's](https://clayyount.com/) and a mysterious man's help!

Yo! Welcome to my no pressure hobby that will be updated when I feel like it!  I'm going to be on the daily editing this and hopefully updating this with artwork, widgets, and things to show you what I've been up to as well as the life I live.

I hope I can make this website the way I want it to look, and make sure to keep creating.  I have a lot of stuff to share, and didn't want to setup another type of art profile on some website somewhere.  This can be thought of as my mother's fridge, stuff I'm really proud of and want people to see.  I can't wait to see what I can do with this setup I have now.  There's a mountain of stuff I want to do for my website, and along the way hopefully I learn more about static web design and constructing comics for the fridge!

Anyway, I'll have more changes on the way!

You may not be aware of this, but I've been drawing webcomics off and on again since 2000. I've taken some long breaks and my update schedule has been spotty at best, but I've always considered it a part of my identity. I draw comics, even if I'n not drawing them *right now*.

There is a small subset of my readership that knows that before there was Hamlet's Danish, and before there was Rob and Elliot, I did a webcomic called Ghostcat. It wasn't very good, but after it ended in 2003, I adopted the title as my internet handle. I was "ghostcat" online, and I associated it with my comic artist identity.

Today, I'm ressurecting the title "Ghostcat Comics" for a new series that I'm really excited about. They are shorter and more direct than Hamlet's Danish comics, and they are formatted for social media. I'll be posting them on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/ghostcat), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/clayyount), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/clayyount), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/u/ghostcat), and wherever else I can think of, so be sure to follow me, and I'll bring the comics to you!
